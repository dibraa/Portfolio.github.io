              <h2>Technology Timeline Infographics</h2>
              <p>September 2, 2024</p>
              <br>
              <p style="text-indent: 30px;">From this activity, I learned how significant the Transistor Era (1947-1962) was in shaping
                 modern technology. The invention of the transistor by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, 
                 and William Shockley replaced bulky vacuum tubes, leading to smaller and more efficient
                  devices like early computers and portable radios. I understood how this innovation not 
                  only revolutionized industries like computing and telecommunications but also impacted 
                  society by making technology more accessible. This activity taught me the importance of 
                  technological advancements and how collaboration and innovation can create lasting changes
                   that continue to influence our lives today.</p>

            <br>
            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">From this activity, I learned about the serious consequences of 
               identity theft and how it can affect individuals and communities. The case of Mark Joseph 
               Lontok, a public school teacher in the Philippines, showed how sharing personal information 
               online, like posting a photo of his PRC ID, led to significant financial and emotional 
               difficulties. This incident highlights the importance of protecting sensitive data and being 
               cautious about online behavior. I also realized the need for stricter regulations from 
               institutions like banks and government agencies to prevent such crimes, as well as public 
               awareness campaigns to educate people on the dangers of oversharing personal details. Overall,
                this activity taught me how crucial it is to safeguard personal information in the digital age.</p>

             <br>
             <p style="text-indent: 30px;">From this HTML activity, I learned how to structure a basic webpage using HTML elements effectively. 
                The document showcases the use of various tags like html, head, and body to define the structure of
                a webpage. The h1 to h6 tags were used to create headings of different sizes, demonstrating how 
                to organize content hierarchically. Lists were created using ul for unordered lists and li for
                list items, which are useful for presenting data like hobbies and pet peeves in a clear and 
                organized way.</p>

             <h2>Wireframe Creation for Your Portfolio Website</h2>
             <p>October 29, 2024</p>
             <br>
             <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                From this activity, I learned the importance of creating a wireframe as a foundational step in
                 website development. A wireframe helps visualize the layout and structure of a webpage by 
                 organizing content, navigation, and user interface elements in a simple, design-neutral format.
                  This process allows me to plan the flow of information and functionality of the site effectively 
                  before writing any code. I also realized how wireframes make it easier to communicate ideas and 
                  align them with project goals, ensuring a clear vision for the final design. This activity taught
                   me that planning ahead through wireframing can save time, reduce errors, and result in a more 
                   user-friendly website.</p>
